# Appspecs

This directory contains the appspecs for the various applications that are part of the project. These files define the `gmt-server` and `gmt-api` services, as well as the scripts to start and stop them.

## Ci vs prod

### Ci

The ci directory contains the appspecs for the ci environment. These appspecs are used to deploy the services to ci environments during pull requests.

### Prod

TODO: Currently, we do not provide or maintain any production environment. Someday, we might have a prod directory with appspecs for the production environment.
